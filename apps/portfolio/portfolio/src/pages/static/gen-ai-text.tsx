export const body = `Below is a "prompt generator" to help take your idea and provide an interface to edit and format the text in a way to increase the probability of receiving the desired response from your desired generative-ai model. I use Google Gemini through Vertex API. The types of generation listed above can be used to test your prompt, and if you are happy with the result, please feel free to use and enjoy the portal. In order to add or take away emphasis on a certain word or phrase, use + or minus with no spaces for the word. Such as: 'Make me a picture of a red++ sun,' this adds emphasis (or weight) to the part that is more, or most, important. You can add as many + or - as you would like to signify more or less weight.`;
