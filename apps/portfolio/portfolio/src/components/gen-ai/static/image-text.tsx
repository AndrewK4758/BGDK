  "Imagen 3 is Google's latest text-to-image AI model, generating high-quality images from detailed text descriptions. Trained on an extensive dataset of text-image pairs, Imagen 3 excels at creating photorealistic images with accurate details and composition. This model can be used for various applications, including creative visualization, design prototyping, and generating visual content for marketing and advertising. Access Imagen 3 through Google's Vertex AI platform or the Gemini API to explore its capabilities.";

export const seedTooltipText =
  "The seed property in Imagen 3's configuration is an optional parameter that allows you to control the randomness of the image generation process. By providing a specific seed value (an integer), you can ensure that the same prompt will consistently generate the same image. This is useful for reproducibility and for exploring variations of an image by changing other parameters while keeping the seed constant. If you don't provide a seed, Imagen 3 will use a random seed, resulting in different images each time you generate with the same prompt.";
